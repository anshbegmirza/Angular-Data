2.1. Module Introduction
-- What modules are and how they work in combining to the final product.

2.2. How an Angular App gets Loaded and Started
-- How the final app is loaded from the root app components and all the style sheets are added to it and the typescript is converted to javascript.

2.3. Components are Important!
-- Angular in the end is a JS framework, changing your DOM("HTML") at runtime !
-- Components are subparts of a main page they might have their own html, css styling and JS.
-- Also the main benefit of components is that they have their own business logic meaning we can use a component multiple times.

2.4. Creating a New Component
-- name your folders the same as the component name
-- so in simple terms a component is nothing but a tsc class.

-- To create a component you have to make a folder in the app, name it the same as the component name then create its typescript file and html file.

-- import the required modules and decorate it using component from angular/converted

2.5. Understanding the Role of AppModule and Component Declaration
-- Creating the component is just not enough. We have to import it in the app.module.ts
-- add it under the declarations and import it in the top.

2.6. Using Custom Components
-- in the app.component.html add our new component that is (app-server to it)

2.7. Creating Components with the CLI & Nesting Components
-- Added multiple components into one component (nesting I mean)

2.8. Working with Component Templates
-- If the html code is lesser like only 2 lines we can use a template instead of templateURL.

2.9. Working with Component Styles
-- We can give multi lines of css to the styles tag in (app.componenet.ts.).
.

2.10.Fully Understanding the Component Selector 11 and 12
-- Created some 2 components, added them in the app componenet.

2.13 What is Databinding
-- Using databinding to display on our componenets.
-- In simple communication between your typescript code and template html

2.14. String Interpolation
-- After the string interpolation a string is returned in the end.

2.15. Property Binding
-- Using it we can change the state of buttons and other things on runtime using function from js

2.16. Property Binding vs String Interpolation
--Dont mix the two
-- practice will make u realise which one to use when

2.17. Event Binding
-- So we cab bind the event on any element using any property we want which leaves us with a pretty huge scope of creating interesting websites and applications.
(input)="onUpdateServerName()" this how you can do event binding.
2.18 Read that small para to understand when and how we can bind events

2.19. Passing and Using Data with Event Binding
(input)="onUpdateServerName($event)
$event is a special reserved keyword which on action gives us the event obj that just happened.

2.21. Two-Way-Databinding
-- In two way data binding we use property binding and event binding both together.
--Like this
-- [(ngModel)]="serverName"

2.22. Combining all Forms of Databinding
-- Combined all the form of data binding and made the button activated with a text printing below it.

2.23 & 2.24. [OPTIONAL] Assignment Solution
Completed this task üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

2.25. Understanding Directives
--Directives are instructions in the DOM!
--Components are also directives.

2.26. Using ngIf to Output Data Conditionally
-- Structural directive use to conditional set things on elements using methods or any thing which returns a true or false statement.
-- \*ngIf="serverCreated"

2.27. Enhancing ngIf with an Else Condition

<p *ngIf="serverCreated; else noServer">Server was created, server name is {{serverName}}</p>
<ng-template #noServer>
  <p>No server was created.</p>
</ng-template>

Understand the concept of ngIf and else using the above ode in the servers.component.html and its tsc file.
27th January, 2025

2.28. Styling Elements Dynamically with ngStyle
--Using ngStyle directive we can change the style of an element conditionally.

2.29. Applying CSS Classes Dynamically with ngClass
--To add dynamically add and remove classes.
We can use it to add css classes using conditions

[ngClass]="{online:serverStatus==='online'}

online is the class name which we want to add
and the serverStatus is the condition cherker.

2.30. Outputting Lists with ngFor

--We use an ng for loop to output the server list on button clicks.

2.32. [OPTIONAL] Assignment Solution
--Please view the assignment-3 solution for the solution of the task given.

2.33. Getting the Index when using ngFor
--Using two ngFor loops one to get the data, and the other to get the index.

5.66 - Module Introduction
-- Introduction to what we are going to learn in this module.

5.67 - Splitting Apps into Components
-- Splited our app into two sections cockpit component and server Elements component.

5.68 - Property Event Binding Overview
-- Understanding what event binding is, and how we can event bind things from two different components.

5.69 - Binding to Custom Properties
-- Binded the server and cockpit together.

5.70 - Assigning an Alias to Custom Properties
-- In the @input we can add the alias name that we want.

-- LIKE THIS :

// srvElement is the alias name of the element which we will use outside this component to bind it to different things.

5.71 - Binding to Custom Events
-- Custom made events for our needs
(serverCreated)="onServerAdded($event)"

5.72 - Assigning an Alias to Custom Events
-- Learned about component communication how different components interact with each other and how we can make them listen.

5.73 - Custom Property and Event Binding Summary
-- TO REVISE COMPONENT COMMUNICATION WATCH THIS LECTURE !

5.74 - Understanding View Encapsulation
-- Just knowing what encapsulation is.

5.75. More on View Encapsulation
-- Nothing much to leran from this video, although we can use something called encapsulation to inheirt components css properties.

5.76 - Using Local References in Templates
-- We can use local reference using # symbol and name of our choice.

5.78 - Getting Access to the Template DOM with V
-- Used local reference to get elements without using two way binding.

5.79 - Projecting Content into Components with n
-- Using ng-content we can get data from the children which we have created kind of.

5.80 - Understanding the Component Lifecycle

--ngOnChanges - Called after a bound input property changes.

--ngOnInit - Called once the component is initialized.

--ngDoCheck - Called during every change detection run.

--ngAfterContentInit - Called after content(ng-content) has been project into view.

--ngAfterViewInit - Called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized.

--ngAfterViewChecked - Called every time the view ( and child views) have been checked.

--ngOnDestroy - Called once the component is about to be destroyed.

                            Components & Databinding (Course Project)

===========================================================================================

--> Applying components & Databining in Course Project.

6.1. Introduction
-- We will create a working communication between our components that will make them work with each other in a much better way.

6.2. Adding Navigation with Event Binding and ngIf
-- Added navigation and event binding in the header navigation component.
6.3. Passing Recipe Data with Property Binding

-- So when I wanted to assign the recipe to the recipe model I created it told me that it cant be null , so use the below approach.

    Recommended Approach:
        The most common and recommended approach is using the non-null assertion operator (!) when you're sure the value will be provided by the parent component. This avoids unnecessary initialization and maintains type safety.

6.4. Passing Data with Event and Property Binding (Combined)
-- We passed the recipe list data from one component to another using local reference and view child, creating custom events and adding them to the other components.

-- We use custom property binding and custom event binding to ensure that we are properly able to link components.

6.6. Allowing the User to Add Ingredients to the Shopping List
-- #Gold mine lecture
-- Really nice leacture to revise viewchild and local refernce whenever stuck

-->> This external lecture apart from the course is also really nice to revise view child in detail.

===========================================================================================

7.1 Module Introduction
-- Introduction to directives and Attribute and Structural Directives.
-- Going to learn about more of Attribute Directives && Structural Directives.

7.2. ngFor and ngIf Recap
-- <li class="list-group-item" *ngFor="let number of numbers" *ngIf="number % 2 == 0">
-- This wont work because we cant have more than one structural directive on 1 element.

7.3. ngClass and ngStyle Recap
-- Used ngClass and ngStyle to make the odd and even numbers look good.

7.4. Creating a Basic Attribute Directive
-- Created a basic highlight directive module which we can use whenever we want.

7.5. Using the Renderer to build a Better Attribute Directive
-- ng generate directive better-highlight
-- ng g d better-highlight
-- Learn more about angular renderer in this link
https://v17.angular.io/api/core/Renderer2

7.7. Using HostListener to Listen to Host Events
-- Using hostlistener we can create interactive events subjected to specific styles.

7.8. Using HostBinding to Bind to Host Properties
-- Instead of using renderer we can creater a hostbinding of the specified property and then use it to change the style property of the dom whenever we need it to change.

## 7.9. Binding to Directive Properties
